<h1>Spout.NET</h1>

<p>Spout.NET is a C# .NET Implementation for <a href="https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2" target="_blank">Spout2</a>, A video frame sharing system for Windows.</p>

<p>This version is specifically cleaned up for my own purposes. It removes the dependencies on CppSharp and OpenGL.NET. Also makes it possible to use it in .NET 6+</p>

## Installation

Clone this repository into your own project.

## Usage

The API of this mapping library is **completely consistent** with the Spout SDK, so you can refer to the [Spout SDK Documentation](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/blob/2.006/SpoutSDK/Documentation/SpoutSDK.pdf) for development. You can use Marshal Class to avoid unsafe code.
